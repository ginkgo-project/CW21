# Summary

> PN: I guess it would include the challenges on writing code for research and how
> to tackle them by including practical software development (git, CI, PR and so
> on) in course-work (like we do in the course).

> TC: Maybe if you make the paper like, doing this sort of CI based course with peer
> review allowed to cope with the COVID-19 related regulations (no in place
> meeting, etc) and still do some form of team building (maybe?).


> TC: I guess related to that could be the ongoing PSE project and its dynamics with
> the external guy able to integrate thanks to using github based PR etc.


> PN: [Does the paper match CW21 theme?]

> TC: I think it matches as well, if nothing else for the fact that you teach
> courses mainly to find students to join your team, that's part of team
> dynamics for me

> TC: But also, practical courses such as these are team dynamics themselves I would say, at least that's exactly what your idea is doing. [i.e., it's possible to present this idea as novel: creating a software engineering teams dynamics in an HPC course.]
