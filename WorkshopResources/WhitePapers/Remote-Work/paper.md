# Summary

This is a temporary title, please change it.

> TC: Another paper idea which isn't very original is in general the experience
> with moving to digital in the team, switch to slack as main driver, addition
> of daily meetings and issues with those, finally issues trying to move to a
> sort of kanban system: trello wasn't satisfactory, people have their own tools
> usually (own todo system, org mode or another) and keeping 5+ platform in sync
> is a terrible idea, as is forcing everyone to use the same platform.
